This repository is an implementation of a technical challenge that can be found [http://blog.csdn.net/bigdata_lijun/article/details/11272335](here).

The python implementation took about 40 minutes,(+10 for the optimization proposed in the `optimization` branch) though much more time was spent thinking of the problem offline.

The Scala and Clojure implementation were done afterwards, as toy projects to learn new languages.
